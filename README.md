# gps-toll-based-system-simulation-using-python
### Overview
The GPS Toll System is a modern toll collection solution that uses GPS data to track vehicle movements and calculate toll fees based on distance, vehicle type, peak hours, and frequent user discounts. This project includes real-time vehicle tracking, dynamic toll calculation, emergency monitoring, and a command-line interface for easy interaction.

### Features
Real-time GPS tracking: Tracks vehicle locations and displays them on an interactive map.
Dynamic toll calculation: Calculates toll fees based on distance, vehicle type, peak hours, and discounts.
Emergency monitoring: Alerts if a vehicle is stationary for too long.
Simulation: Uses simpy to simulate vehicle movements and interactions.
Command-line interface: Allows users to interact with the system easily.
Transaction logging: Records all transactions and provides a history log.
